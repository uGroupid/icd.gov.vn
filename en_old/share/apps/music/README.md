## Supported formats

* FLAC (`audio/flac`)
* MP3 (`audio/mpeg`)
* Vorbis in OGG container (`audio/ogg`)
* Opus in OGG container (`audio/ogg` or `audio/opus`)
* All formats listed for your browser on [this table](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Supported_media_formats#Browser_compatibility)

_Note: it might be unable to play some particular files._

_Note: sometimes it might be unable to play all FLAC and MP3 files (especially in Firefox), in this case restarting the browser may help._

### Detail

This app utilizes 2 backend players: Aurora.js and SoundManager2.

Aurora.js uses Javascript and HTML5 Audio API to decode and play music, it doesn't use the browser's built-in codec. This app choose Aurora.js for FLAC and MP3 files.

SoundManager2 utilizes the browser's built-in codec, This app choose SoundManager2 for OGG files.

## Usage hints

### Commands

Following commands are available(see script occ in your ownCloud root folder):

#### Scan music files

	./occ music:scan USERNAME1 USERNAME2 ...

This scans all not scanned music files of the user USERNAME and saves the extracted metadata into the music tables in the database. This is also done if you browse the music app web interface. There the scan is done in steps of 20 tracks and the current state is visible at the bottom of the interface.

	./occ music:scan --all

This scans music files for all users.

Both of the above commands can be combined with the `--debug` switch, which enables debug output and shows the memory usage of each scan step.

#### Reset scanned metadata

**Warning:** This command will delete data! It will remove unavailable tracks from playlists as playlists are linked against the track metadata.

	./occ music:reset-database USERNAME1 USERNAME2 ...

This will reset the scanned metadata of the provided users.

	./occ music:reset-database --all

This will reset the scanned metadata of all users.

### Ampache

In the settings the URL you need for Ampache is listed and looks like this:

```
https://cloud.domain.org/index.php/apps/music/ampache/
```

This is the common path. Some clients append the last part (`server/xml.server.php`) automatically. If you have connection problems try the longer version of the URL with the `server/xml.server.php` appended.

#### Authentication

To use Ampache you can't use your ownCloud password. Instead, you need to generate APIKEY for Ampache.
Go to "Your username" â†’ "Personal", and check section Music/Ampache, where you can generate your key. Enter your ownCloud username and the generated key as password to your client.

### Installation

Music App can be installed using the App Management in ownCloud. Instructions can be found [here](https://doc.owncloud.org/server/8.1/admin_manual/installation/apps_management_installation.html).

### Known issues

#### Huge music collections

The current version doesn't scale well for huge music collections. There are plans for a kind of paginated version, which hides the pagination and should be useable as known before. #78

#### Application can not be activated because of illegal code

The current music app can't be installed and ownCloud prints following error message:
"Application can not be activated because of illegal code". This is due to the appcodechecker in core (which is kind of broken), but you can do the installation if the appcodechecker is deactivated:

* set `appcodechecker` to `false` in `config.php` (see the [config.sample.php](https://github.com/owncloud/core/blob/a8861c70c8e5876a961f00e49db88843432bf7ba/config/config.sample.php#L164) )
* now you can install the app
* afterwards re-enable the appcodechecker
